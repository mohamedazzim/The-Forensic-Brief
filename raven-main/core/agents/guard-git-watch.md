# Skill Guard — Sensitive File Protection

## Monitored files (NEVER read by any skill)
- `.raven/manifest.secrets.json`
- `.env`, `.env.*`
- `*.pem`, `*.key`, `id_rsa`, `id_ed25519`
- `.claude/settings.json` (read-only — no skill may modify)
- `.raven/manifest.json` (read-only for skills — modify via /raven-approve only)

## On detection
If any skill attempts to read or modify monitored files:
1. HARD BLOCK the action immediately
2. Output: "⚠️ Skill {name} attempted restricted file access — blocked"
3. Log: skill name, file attempted, timestamp
4. Warn developer to audit the skill

## Approved skills check
On session start, compare loaded skills against manifest.approved_skills.
Any unlisted skill → WARN: "Unapproved skill detected: {name}. Add to manifest.approved_skills to permit."
