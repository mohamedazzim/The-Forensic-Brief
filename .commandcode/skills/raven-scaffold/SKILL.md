# /scaffold

Before writing any code:

1. Read .raven/manifest.json — confirm stack
2. Read .raven/architecture.md — understand current system
3. Ask: "What are you building?" (one sentence)
4. Generate:
   - **Dependency map** — what this touches, what it needs
   - **File structure** — files to create, max 150 lines each
   - **Implementation sequence** — order of operations
   - **Risk flags** — anything that could break existing components
5. Output plan. Wait for confirmation before writing a single line.
